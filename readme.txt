How to play?
	Once you hit the start button, a clown image shows and you have about 47 seconds to reach 400 
	points with less than 21 misses. Using your cursor to click the clown image counts as a hit, 
	which add points to your score. If you click outside the image, then that counts as a miss, 
	which adds miss points to your score. The clown moves faster at later stages and every stage, 
	you get more points when you hit the clown image. First stage is one point, second stage is 5 
	points, and third stage is 25 points. The stop button stops the game and you would have to start 
	a new game after that by clicking the start button again.
